### BlochTrace

Blochsphere(<a href="https://bloch.kherb.io/">https://bloch.kherb.io/</a>) only allows you to visualize current state of the qubit. But, what if you wanted to visualize what happened to the qubit before reaching that state ?
BlochTrace allows you to trace the path, which is snapshot of states the qubits followed in a given circuit. Each of qubits of the circuit are assumed to be in pure states. It shows the states as path of arrows from origin in 3D space.
Each arrow in the trace represents snapshot of applying an operation on the qubit.
